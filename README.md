## S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems

These are an adaptation of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied
Sciences in Berne, Switzerland. I (Phil Gold) have altered them to be more amenable to programming in Scala. Feedback is
appreciated, particularly on anything marked TODO.
